# This script configures Nginx to listen on port 80

# First, check the current Nginx configuration
# Common issue is that another service might be using port 80 or Nginx is misconfigured

# Remove the default site configuration that might be blocking port 80
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Restart Nginx to apply changes
service nginx restart
